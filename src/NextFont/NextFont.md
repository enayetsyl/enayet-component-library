# Mastering Font Customization in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction:

- Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering font customization in Next.js! Fonts play a crucial role in shaping the visual identity and user experience of a website or application. With Next.js, a popular React framework for building web applications, you have the power to seamlessly integrate and customize fonts to suit your project's unique style and requirements.

- In this guide, we'll walk you through two methods of customizing fonts in Next.js: using custom Google fonts with variables and class names, and leveraging Tailwind CSS configuration. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find step-by-step instructions and code examples to help you enhance the typography of your Next.js projects.

- Get ready to elevate the aesthetics of your web applications as we delve into the world of font customization with Next.js!

### Using custom google font using variable and class name. 

- In our example we will use three fonts to understand the customization of google font in next js.

- To begin with create a next js project. 

- Open the layout.js file. At the top of the file import following

```javascript
import {  Roboto, Oswald, Kanit } from "next/font/google";
```
- Here i imported the Roboto, the Oswald and the Kanit font from google. You can import according to your choice. 

- Now paste the following code below the import statement. 

```javascript
const roboto = Roboto({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500", "700", "900"],
  variable: '--font-roboto',
})
const oswald = Oswald({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500", "700", "600"],
  variable: '--font-oswald',
})
const kanit = Kanit({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500","600", "700", "800", "900" ],
  variable: '--font-kanit',
})
```
- For each font i created a variable and initialized that font. Inside the curly brace, I mentioned the subset, the font weight, and created a variable. 

- In your case you should write the weight of the font that you want to use in your project inside the array. 

- The variable value should start with -- then the word "font" and then - again and at last the name you want to provide.

- Go to the body tag and replace it with the following code.

```javascript
 <body className={`${roboto.variable} ${oswald.variable} ${kanit.variable}`}>
  {children}
</body>
```
- For each font you have to do the above. Write the variable name that we created earlier then a period then the word "variable".

- Now open the global.css file and create a class for each font as follows:

```javascript
  .roboto {
  font-family: var(--font-roboto);
}
.oswald {
  font-family: var(--font-oswald);
}
.kanit {
  font-family: var(--font-kanit);
}
```
- Instead of .roboto, .oswald, .kanit, you can use any other name. Inside the parentheses you have to write the name that you used at declaring variable at layout.js file. 

- Finally use the variable in the html tag. 

```javascript
  
export default function Home() {
  return (
   <>
   <div>
   <h1 className="text-5xl roboto">Roboto</h1>
   <h1 className="text-5xl oswald">Oswald</h1>
   <h1 className="text-5xl kanit">Kanit</h1>
   </div>
   </>
  );
}

```

### Using custom google font using tailwind configuration

- In our example we will use three fonts to understand the customization of google font in Next Js.

- To start create a next js project. 

- Inside the src directory create a folder with the name of utils and inside it create a file named fonts.js. Paste the following code inside it.

```javascript
import {  Roboto, Oswald, Kanit } from "next/font/google";


const roboto_init = Roboto({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500", "700", "900"],
  variable: '--font-roboto',
})
const oswald_init = Oswald({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500", "700", "600"],
  variable: '--font-oswald',
})
const kanit_init = Kanit({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:["300", "400", "500","600", "700", "800", "900" ],
  variable: '--font-kanit',
})

export const roboto = roboto_init.variable
export const oswald = oswald_init.variable
export const kanit = kanit_init.variable
```
- Here i modularize the code so our code will look clean. 

- To begin with i imported the fonts.

- Next i initiates them and store into a variable. The name of variable is changed here. Instead of roboto i used roboto_init and so on.

- Finally i export the variable property so that it can be used in the layout.js file.

- Now open the layout.js file and paste the following code

```javascript
import { kanit, oswald, roboto } from "@/utils/fonts";

<body className={`${roboto} ${oswald} ${kanit}`}>
{children}
</body>
```

- I imported the variables from the utils folder.

- Inside the body tag the variables are used. 

- Open the tailwind.config.js file and inside the extend add fontFamily property and paste following values 

```javascript
fontFamily: {
        roboto: ['var(--font-roboto)'],
        oswald: ['var(--font-oswald)'],
        kanit: ['var(--font-kanit)'],
      }
```
- The full code of tailwind.config.js file should look like as follows
```javascript
  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      backgroundImage: {
        "gradient-radial": "radial-gradient(var(--tw-gradient-stops))",
        "gradient-conic":
          "conic-gradient(from 180deg at 50% 50%, var(--tw-gradient-stops))",
      },
      fontFamily: {
        roboto: ['var(--font-roboto)'],
        oswald: ['var(--font-oswald)'],
        kanit: ['var(--font-kanit)'],
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};

```
- Now open the file where you want to apply the font. In my case i will use it inside the home page.

```javascript

export default function Home() {
  return (
   <>
   <div>
   <h1 className="text-5xl font-roboto">Roboto</h1>
   <h1 className="text-5xl font-oswald">Oswald</h1>
   <h1 className="text-5xl font-kanit">Kanit</h1>
   </div>
   </>
  );
}
```
- If you are using the Tailwind configuration, make sure to prefix the font name with 'font-' as shown above.
